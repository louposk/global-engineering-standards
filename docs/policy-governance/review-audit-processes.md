2. **Security**: No security vulnerabilities introduced
3. **Performance**: No significant performance degradation
4. **Maintainability**: Code is readable and well-documented
5. **Standards Compliance**: Follows coding standards and guidelines

#### Review Process
1. Developer creates pull request with clear description
2. Automated checks run (tests, linting, security scans)
3. Reviewers examine code and provide feedback
4. Developer addresses feedback and updates code
5. Final approval and merge to main branch
