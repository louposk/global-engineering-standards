# CI/CD Pipelines

Comprehensive guide to designing, implementing, and managing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines for reliable software delivery.

## Overview

CI/CD pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes, enabling teams to deliver software quickly and reliably while maintaining high quality standards.

## Pipeline Design Principles

### Fail Fast Philosophy
- **Early Detection** - Identify issues as early as possible in the pipeline
- **Quick Feedback** - Provide immediate feedback to developers
- **Minimal Resource Usage** - Optimize for speed and resource efficiency
- **Clear Error Messages** - Provide actionable error information

### Pipeline as Code
- **Version Controlled** - Store pipeline definitions in source control
- **Reproducible** - Ensure consistent pipeline execution
- **Auditable** - Track changes and maintain history
- **Collaborative** - Enable team collaboration on pipeline improvements

## Continuous Integration (CI)

### Source Code Management
- **Branch Strategy** - Implement effective branching strategies (GitFlow, GitHub Flow)
- **Commit Standards** - Enforce commit message standards and conventions
- **Code Reviews** - Mandatory peer review processes
- **Merge Policies** - Automated merge policies and protection rules

### Build Process
- **Automated Builds** - Trigger builds on code changes
- **Build Artifacts** - Generate and store build artifacts
- **Dependency Management** - Handle dependencies and package resolution
- **Build Optimization** - Optimize build times through caching and parallelization

### Testing Integration
- **Unit Tests** - Execute comprehensive unit test suites
- **Integration Tests** - Run integration tests against external dependencies
- **Code Quality Checks** - Perform static code analysis and quality gates
- **Security Scans** - Integrate security vulnerability scanning

## Continuous Deployment (CD)

### Deployment Strategies
- **Blue-Green Deployment** - Switch between two identical production environments
- **Canary Deployment** - Gradual rollout to subset of users
- **Rolling Deployment** - Sequential deployment across multiple instances
- **Feature Flags** - Control feature rollouts independently of deployments

### Environment Management
- **Environment Parity** - Maintain consistency across environments
- **Infrastructure as Code** - Automate infrastructure provisioning
- **Configuration Management** - Manage environment-specific configurations
- **Secrets Management** - Secure handling of sensitive information

### Deployment Automation
- **Automated Deployment** - Zero-touch deployment processes
- **Deployment Validation** - Automated validation of successful deployments
- **Rollback Mechanisms** - Automated rollback on deployment failures
- **Monitoring Integration** - Real-time monitoring during deployments

## Pipeline Implementation

### GitHub Actions
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run build

  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Production
        run: echo "Deploying to production..."
```

### GitLab CI/CD
```yaml
stages:
  - test
  - build
  - deploy

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm ci
    - npm test
  only:
    - merge_requests
    - main

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm run build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - ./deploy.sh
  only:
    - main
```

### Jenkins Pipeline
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                checkout scm
            }
        }
        
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm ci'
                sh 'npm run build'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm test'
            }
            post {
                always {
                    publishTestResults testResultsPattern: 'test-results.xml'
                }
            }
        }
        
        stage('Deploy') {
            when {
                branch 'main'
            }
            steps {
                sh './deploy.sh'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
