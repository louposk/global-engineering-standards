# Designing Pipelines

Best practices and methodologies for designing effective CI/CD pipelines that scale with your organization.

## Pipeline Design Fundamentals

### Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility** - Each pipeline stage should have a clear, single purpose
- **Idempotency** - Pipeline executions should produce consistent results
- **Fail Fast** - Detect and report failures as early as possible
- **Parallelization** - Execute independent tasks concurrently for efficiency

### Pipeline Architecture Patterns
- **Linear Pipeline** - Sequential execution of stages
- **Fan-out/Fan-in** - Parallel execution with result aggregation
- **Matrix Builds** - Testing across multiple configurations
- **Conditional Execution** - Dynamic pipeline behavior based on conditions

## Stage Design Guidelines

### Source Stage
- **Trigger Configuration** - Define appropriate triggers (push, PR, schedule)
- **Branch Strategies** - Implement branch-specific pipeline behaviors
- **Change Detection** - Optimize for changed components only
- **Artifact Versioning** - Consistent versioning strategies

### Build Stage
- **Build Optimization** - Minimize build times through caching and incremental builds
- **Dependency Management** - Secure and consistent dependency resolution
- **Artifact Generation** - Produce deployable artifacts
- **Build Validation** - Verify build integrity and completeness

### Test Stage
- **Test Pyramid** - Implement appropriate test mix (unit, integration, e2e)
- **Parallel Testing** - Execute tests concurrently for faster feedback
- **Test Data Management** - Manage test data lifecycle and consistency
- **Flaky Test Handling** - Identify and manage unreliable tests

### Deploy Stage
- **Environment Strategy** - Define environment promotion paths
- **Deployment Patterns** - Implement safe deployment strategies
- **Rollback Planning** - Design for quick recovery from failures
- **Monitoring Integration** - Enable observability from deployment start

## Advanced Pipeline Patterns

### Multi-Environment Pipelines
```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy-dev
  - test-integration
  - deploy-staging
  - test-e2e
  - deploy-prod
```

### Feature Branch Pipelines
- **Pull Request Validation** - Comprehensive testing before merge
- **Environment Provisioning** - Temporary environments for feature testing
- **Cleanup Automation** - Automatic resource cleanup after merge

### Release Pipelines
- **Version Management** - Automated version bumping and tagging
- **Release Notes** - Automated generation of release documentation
- **Approval Gates** - Manual approval processes for production deployments
- **Post-Release Validation** - Automated validation of production deployments
