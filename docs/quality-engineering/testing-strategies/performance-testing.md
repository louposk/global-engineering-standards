# Performance Testing

Comprehensive strategies for validating system performance, scalability, and reliability under various load conditions to ensure optimal user experience and system stability.

## Overview

Performance testing evaluates how a system performs under various load conditions, measuring response times, throughput, resource utilization, and stability. It helps identify bottlenecks, validate scalability requirements, and ensure the system can handle expected and peak loads while maintaining acceptable performance levels.

## Types of Performance Testing

### Load Testing

### Stress Testing
- **Breaking Point Testing** - Maximum load the system can handle before failure
- **Resource Exhaustion** - Behavior when system resources are depleted
- **Failure Recovery** - System recovery after stress-induced failures
- **Graceful Degradation** - How system handles overload conditions

### Volume Testing
- **Large Data Sets** - Performance with realistic data volumes
- **Database Performance** - Query performance with production-sized data

  ],
  thresholds: {
    'http_req_duration': ['p(95)&lt;500'], // 95% of requests under 500ms
    'http_req_failed': ['rate&lt;0.01'],   // Error rate under 1%
  },
};

export default function() {
  group('User Login Flow', function() {
    let response = http.get('https://api.example.com/login');
    check(response, {
      'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
